This program uses regular expressions to split each sentence in the file into individual words, then checks how many of those words match the set of racial slurs provided. The program then calculates the degree of profanity as a percentage of total words in the sentence. Finally, the program outputs the original sentence and its calculated profanity degree for each sentence in the file.
