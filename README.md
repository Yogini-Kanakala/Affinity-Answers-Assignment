Questionnaire  solutions

## 1. Imagine there is a file full of Twitter tweets by various users and you are provided a set of words that indicates racial slurs. Write a program that can indicate the degree of profanity for each sentence in the file. Write in any programming language (preferably in Python)-make any assumptions, but remember to state them.

###### Assumptions made in this program:

1. The input file consists of one tweet per line.
2. The racial slurs provided are complete and exhaustive and are taken in a set.
3. The racial slurs provided are comprehensive and accurate.
4. The degree of profanity is calculated based on the ratio of racial slurs to total words in a tweet.


## 2. Which is an interesting data set you discovered recently? Why is it your favorite? 

One of my favourite datasets that we've extracted is what I wanted to share with you. We pulled this code-mixed dataset of Telugu and English comments from a variety of social media sites, including Twitter and YouTube. Considering the difficulties involved in evaluating code-mixed data, I think this specific dataset's quality is quite high, making the task much more fascinating.

Moreover, code-mixed data is pervasive in our digital environment, and learning how to work with it can have a number of advantages, such as:

1) Enhanced comprehension of multilingual communication patterns
2) Improved natural language processing (NLP) model development
3) improved capacity to detect sentiment and emotions in texts written in multiple languages
4) improved intercultural understanding and communication
5) Better cross-cultural communication and understanding
6) Increased accessibility and inclusivity for multilingual communities
So i feel like it is one of the intresting dataset.


Ex:
"Ayyo, English lo cheppandi please. Telugu raadu nenu ardam kaaledhu."(english Translation = ohh,please tell me in english. I can't understand telugu) (NEGATIVE)
"Ippudu chaala baaga artham ayyindhi! Thanks for the explanation." ("english traslation= Now i understood very Clearly Thanks for the explanation. ")(POS)






## 3.Why do we need a database? We can store everything in a file, no?

While it is possible to store data in a file, there are several benefits to using a database instead:

**Scalability:** Databases are made to handle large amounts of data and to scale as the data volume increases. This is crucial for applications that must store and process large amounts of data because storing everything in a single file can become difficult or time-consuming as the data volume increases.
Data integrity: Databases provide built-in mechanisms for ensuring data integrity, such as transaction support and data validation rules. This helps ensure that data is stored correctly and is consistent across all records.

**Data integrity:** Databases provide built-in mechanisms for ensuring data integrity, such as transaction support and data validation rules. This helps ensure that data is stored correctly and is consistent across all records.

**Querying and searching:** Databases provide powerful query languages that allow you to search and filter data based on various criteria, such as text search, range queries, and sorting. This makes it easy to find and retrieve specific records from the database.

**Concurrency:** Databases are designed to handle multiple users accessing the data simultaneously, which can be difficult with a file-based system.

**Security:** Databases provide builtin security features to protect the data, such as user authentication and access control.

For applications that need to store and process huge amounts of data, using a database can generally offer several advantages over keeping data in a file.
